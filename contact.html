        <h2>Seventeen to return with mini album 'Spill the Feels' in October</h2>
        <article> 
            <p> Pledis Entertainment has announced that Seventeen will make their comeback on October 14th with their new mini album, 'Spill the Feels.'
                'Spill the Feels' marks Seventeen’s 12th mini album, coming approximately five months after the release of their best album, '17 Is Right Here,' in April.
                Seventeen also revealed a teaser video showcasing the album’s title on HYBE Labels' YouTube channel and their official social media accounts.
</p>
           <p>
            The teaser features a subway station advertisement that initially reads “I FELT HELPLESS,” which then transforms into “SPILL THE FEELS.” Accompanied by mysterious music, the video transitions from the gloomy subway station atmosphere to sunlight pouring in, revealing a new space beyond the window, hinting at Seventeen’s signature positive message.
            In a statement, the agency said, “Seventeen’s 12th mini album will tell a story that anyone can relate to, aiming to connect with listeners around the world. We hope for great anticipation for this album, which will showcase Seventeen's identity and evolution.
            ”Seventeen will kick off their world tour, 'Right Here,' starting with two shows at Goyang Sports Complex Stadium on October 12th and 13th, followed by stops in the U.S., Japan, and across Asia.

        <h2>SEVENTEEN’s Hoshi and Woozi to debut as a sub-unit with ‘Beam’</h2>
        <p>
            SEVENTEEN members Hoshi and Woozi will be debuting in a new sub-unit with the release of a new single album, ‘Beam’. SEVENTEEN announced the new sub-unit via their social media channels on February 19 at midnight KST. Two different teaser clips were unveiled, revealing the album’s logo and a brief glimpse into the concept for the sub-unit.
            The duo – dubbed Hoshi X Woozi – are set to release their debut single album titled ‘Beam’ on March 10 at 6pm KST. Further details regarding its title track and tracklist are expected in the coming weeks. The news of Hoshi and Woozi’s upcoming sub-unite debut comes a few days after SEVENTEEN’s final show for their ’17 Is Right Here’ world tour, which concluded with a two-night stint in Bangkok on February 15 and 16.

            The duo will also be the second SEVENTEEN sub-unit to release music in 2025, with BSS – comprising Hoshi, DK and Seungkwan – releasing the ‘Teleparty’ single album last month. The record marked their first comeback in two years, headlined by title track ‘CBZ (Prime Time)’.
